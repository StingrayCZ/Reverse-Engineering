# Reverse Engineering
<p style="text-align:center;"> 
During my work for MCAE Systems s.r.o., I worked as a Reverse Engineering Specialist. On this position I was responsible for reconstructing damage or incomplete parts from 3D scanned meshes.
  
 A typical project was a part from a static, no longer manufactured machine without production documentation and so it is not possible to produce it in the classical way – drawing -> manufacturing. Such a component is scanned and a scanned model (mesh) in .stl format is created. However, this scan contains many undesirable imperfections, such as wear marks. Such a model must be modified using special software. In the event that the damage is large or missing a large part of the model, it is necessary to use other sources of information, such as sketches, photographs or my own intuition. The standard for the quality of the reconstructed CAD model is a smooth surface that smoothly connects to adjacent surfaces while respecting the prescribed tolerance level – normally a ratio of +/_ 0.2 mm.
 
In addition to projects related to engineering, I also came across artistic projects when in which a statue or other artistic 3D object had to be transferred from the real world. For these projects, greater emphasis was placed on the smoothness of the surfaces and hence their light reflectance at the expense of non-essential accuracy.

Unfortunately, these models and meshes are copyrighted under corporate authorship. This means that I m just the author and the owner is my former employer. It doesn't allow me to upload anything here.

You can see these parts in the following samples:
*   Car Wheel Disk
*   Plastic Container
*   Turbine Housing

## Plastic Container (VBF)
This sample represents a model container from HDPE with a smooth and mirrored shape (surfaces).
